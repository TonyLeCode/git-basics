			<h2>Create Your Own Repo</h2>
			<p>Nice! You made it through part 2.</p>
			<p>You were using a clone of my repo, here's how to start a repo from scratch.</p>
			<p
				>Make a new folder OUTSIDE of this project. It should be in a different location otherwise you will get
				errors.</p
			>
			<p
				>Using the terminal inside the new project, type <span class="wrap">git init</span> to initialize your new git
				repository. Git looks at nested folders, which is why you want this project in a different folder.</p
			>
			<p>Create a new empty text file.</p>
			<p
				>If you type <span class="wrap">git status</span> you will see <span class="wrap">Untracked files:</span> This
				means a new file was added but not yet committed and tracked by the repo.</p
			>
			<p>Add and commit just like part 2.</p>
			<p>Create 3 more empty text files.</p>
			<p
				>You'll notice that it might be annoying to add many files at once to the repo. You can stage all files by
				typing <span class="wrap">git add .</span></p
			>
			<p
				>However, be careful as you shouldn't just stage all changes you've made. You should stage changes that makes
				sense together so that it's easier to identify bugs, review specific changes, or revert them.</p
			>
			<p
				>Instead of adding all the text files, open one up and add whatever you want in it. If you don't add this poem
				<a href="https://cthulhufiles.com/stories/chambers/chambers-cassildas-song.html"
					>https://cthulhufiles.com/stories/chambers/chambers-cassildas-song.html</a
				></p
			>
			<p>After that, stage the empty files and commit those with the message "Added empty text files".</p>
			<p>Then add and commit the text file with the poem with the message "Added poem."</p>
