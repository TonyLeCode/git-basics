# Learn Git
Hello, I created this project to help people learn and practice some basic `git` commands.

This is not an in-depth guide, just a way to practice and get into the flow of using `git`.

I'm assuming you know how to use the terminal. You should also install git and set it up. If you haven't, you can easily google it.

After that, the first step is to open up your terminal, and go to wherever you want to place the project folder in. You can then clone this repo with `git clone repository-url`. Replace respository-url with the url of the repository you want to clone. In this case, you would do `git clone https://github.com/TonyLeCode/git-basics`

After you clone the repository, open up the file `index.html` which should open in the browser. Follow the instructions from there.
